##### Key Achievements

In a situation where requirements weren't fully defined but release was necessary, I communicated extensively with the Product Manager to clarify the vision, created prototypes to grasp the image, and revamped both frontend and backend to add features.
Midway through, we adopted Scrum, allowing us to develop while gathering feedback from stakeholders outside the team.
Also, since many members were not proficient in English, which was becoming a barrier as English became the official internal language, I provided support for their learning and participation in meetings.

##### Key Achievements

We needed to go from requirements definition to release in about half a year from scratch. Simultaneously, we needed to quickly show working screens to domain experts within the team and actual users to get feedback and iterate.
In this context, to ensure codebase maintainability and minimize bugs, I incorporated VRT, Linters, and Formatters into CI/CD, created commands to generate file templates for page creation with a single command, and designed a directory structure that developers wouldn't get lost in (combining Atomic Design and Screaming Architecture).
As a result, we were able to release in about half a year, and even now in operation, we can quickly make corrections based on feedback.

#### November 2022 - Current / Operation of Frontend Cross-Functional Organization

| Languages | Japanese                                               |

##### Responsibilities

- Planning and creation of frontend curriculum for prospective intern employees
- Planning and creation of company-wide frontend guidelines
- Planning and running frontend cross-functional meetings
  - Sharing knowledge on trying out modern libraries
  - Solving frontend issues in products
  - Sharing information about library vulnerabilities

##### Key Achievements

Although there was a company-wide policy to unify the future frontend tech stack with React, the curriculum for prospective interns only covered Ruby on Rails. Catching up on frontend skills until assignment to a product team was left to individuals or the product team's frontend engineers.
In response, I planned and created a curriculum to build a TODO app using React, TypeScript, Next.js, and React Hook Form.
By having prospective interns complete this curriculum first, we were able to raise their skills to roughly the basic level required by product teams.
Furthermore, by creating model implementations alongside the curriculum, engineers reviewing the code (usually engineers from the assigned product team) could encourage feedback without hesitation.

#### October 2022 - February 2023 / New Development & Operation of Professional Appraisal Management System

##### Key Achievements

The project had been partially developed but not released, and most initial engineers had left. I took over the product from another team, so technical debt and lack of documentation were prominent.
Therefore, for frontend, backend, and infrastructure, I established rough coding rules to unify the style of future code and led the refactoring of debt-ridden code in parallel.
This enabled improved development speed for existing members and smoother onboarding for new members.
Also, by establishing ADR writing as a culture, the rationale and overview of implementation started to be documented for major feature implementations.

#### June 2022 - February 2023 / Planning & Operation of Development Camp

- External Outreach
  - [Recommendation for Running a Development Camp - From Planning to Execution of the First Development Camp](https://tech.buysell-technologies.com/entry/2023/03/21/000000)

##### Key Achievements

BuySell Technologies had never held a development camp before, and there was no internal knowledge.
As a leader, referring to examples from other companies and through discussions with operation members, I clarified what the camp should look like.
There were mountains of things to decide, such as purpose, budget, participants, schedule, etc., and we had to proceed in parallel with product development. It was tough, but through frequent surveys to applicants and hearings with the CTO and department heads, we aligned the direction and successfully managed the event day.
As a result, 76% of participants answered with a satisfaction level of 4 or higher (out of 5), and 89% answered they would like to participate again.
Based on this survey result, the next camp has been confirmed.

- Implementation of Frontend/Backend features
- Code Review

## Key Strengths

I am highly conscious of maintaining high product quality while rapidly conducting team development.

In development, I implement the following measures:

- Incorporating Linters and Formatters packed with plugins and custom rules into CI.
- Making sure to write unit tests basically and incorporating them into CI.
- Enabling the generation of necessary file groups for development with a single command.
- Establishing coding guides through discussion with members and adopting a policy of generally not reviewing code that does not follow the guide.

As a result, even newly joined interns can immediately write code that follows the rules, and the review effort for their PRs has been kept to about 5-10 minutes each time.

## Extracurricular Activities

### OSS Activities
